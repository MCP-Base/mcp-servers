## üõ†Ô∏è Contribution Guidelines

- **Stick to the format:** Match the style and structure of existing entries (capitalization, links, spacing, etc.).
- **Alphabetical order:** Entries within each category should be sorted alphabetically.
- **Be accurate:** Double-check names, links, and descriptions.
- **One server per line:** This keeps things clean and easy to scan.
- **Clear and useful descriptions:** Aim for short, meaningful summaries that highlight what the server does.


Thanks for helping grow the MCP ecosystem. Your contribution makes a difference! üôå
